# Whiteboard_App
This Python program was designed to be a feature-rich whiteboard program using the Tkinter library. This program allows users to draw, write, and import images onto a canvas. It has drawing options with customizable line thickness using a slide bar, plus color selection either from a generic color palette or a color chooser window. The program includes an eraser function used to clear the entire canvas. The program also has a toggle switch that will show or hide the text input area of the program. Additionally there is a button used to insert images and then drag the images anywhere on the screen. A modern looking user interface was designed using image buttons and modern-looking icons. The program uses events to deal with mouse interactions for drawing and moving the on-screen elements. The GUI is organized and responsive, and provides a digital canvas for users interacting with the whiteboard application to draw, write, or use for teaching purposes.
